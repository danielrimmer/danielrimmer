## ⚠ OBSERVATIONS (No Breaking Issues)

### Minor Code Style
1. Long HTML lines (49 lines exceed 120 characters)
   - These are primarily data-attribute heavy process steps
   - No functional impact, just formatting

2. Version parameters in assets
   - CSS: v=whoami-14
   - JS: v=process-13
   - Logo: v=1
   - These should be updated when major changes are made

3. Media query organization
   - Multiple levels of media queries (tablet, mobile, desktop)
   - All properly cascading without conflicts

## 🔍 DEBUGGING FINDINGS

### Verified Working Correctly:
- ✓ Responsive layout at all breakpoints
- ✓ RTL layout properly implemented for Hebrew
- ✓ Lazy loading attributes on images (13 images)
- ✓ Video preload="metadata" for performance
- ✓ CSS transitions and animations smooth
- ✓ Form elements properly structured
- ✓ External font imports (Google Fonts)
- ✓ Cursor customization (SVG cursors)

### No Critical Issues Found:
- ✓ No missing closing tags
- ✓ No invalid attribute usage
- ✓ No broken asset references
- ✓ No console errors expected
- ✓ All data attributes properly formatted
